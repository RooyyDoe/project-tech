# Project Tech (GameMate)

This is certainly a dating site but instead of only being about the looks of people, you can meet someone who has a specific skill set and a preference for a select group of games.

# Description feature

When the user makes a new profile I want them to be able to add tags to there profile. So when profiles have the same tags they will match with each other. All these tags will be listed and can be found through a search bar. When the user search for a tag they can select this tag and add it to there profile. When they want to add more or delete tags they can do this on there profile.
